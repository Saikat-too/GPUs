# Introduction

**CPU** is latency oriented . **GPU** design is throughput oriented . The speed of many **graphic** applications is limited by the rate data can be delivered from the memory system into processors and vice versa.  A **GPU** must be capable of moving extremely large amount of data into and out of graphics frame buffers in **DRAM** . The prevailing solution in **GPUs** is to optimize for the execution . The design style is commonly referred to as **throughput-oriented-design** , as it strives to maximize the total execution throughput of a large of threads while
allowing individual threads to take potentially much longer time to execute .
